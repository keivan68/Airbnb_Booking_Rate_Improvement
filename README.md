# Airbnb_bookings

Airbnb is a two sided marketplace which matches guests to hosts. The booking flow at Airbnb is as follows: a guest
finds an available room (listing) that they like, and then they contact the host. Once the guest finds a listing they
are interested in, there are three ways to send the host an inquiry: ‘contact_me’, ‘book_it’, or ‘instant_book’
(detailed at the bottom of this document). Upon receiving the inquiry, the host can then decide whether or not to
accept the request (for ‘contact_me’ and ‘book_it’ methods -- `instant_book` is auto-accepted). One of our goals at
Airbnb is to increase bookings on our platform.

Prompt:
You want to grow bookings in Rio de Janeiro. The team asks you for help with the following:

1. What key metrics would you propose to monitor over time the success of the team's efforts in improving
the guest host matching process and why? Clearly define your metric(s) and explain how each is
computed.

2. What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful bookings in Rio de Janeiro? What
segments are doing well and what could be improved? Propose 2-3 specific recommendations (business
initiatives and product changes) that could address these opportunities. Demonstrate rationale behind
each recommendation AND prioritize your recommendations in order of their estimated impact.
